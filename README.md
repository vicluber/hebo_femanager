# Hebo_femanager
This is an extension to extend functions from https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/femanager
So simple extnsion that is good to use as example or template.
It works as an alternative for this outdated example extension: https://github.com/einpraegsam/femanagerextended

This extension just adds a new varchar field to the default femanager field options. A personal_number attribute to the fe_users table
It has been tested using typo3 10.4
