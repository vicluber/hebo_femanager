# Hebo_femanager
This is a extension to extend functions from https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/femanager

It works as an alternative for this outdated example extension: https://github.com/einpraegsam/femanagerextended

This extension just adds a new varchar field to the default femanager field options.
It has been tested using typo3 10.4
